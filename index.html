            HISTORY OF EDUCATION
          </p>
          <p class="smalltext">
            Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
            knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
            pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
            imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from
            one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their
            knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
            imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at
            the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]

          Education provides students with the space and the opportunities to
          meet like-minded individuals, either on a peer or mentor basis. In
          school, students meet leaders in their field, top professionals, and
          make contacts through extracurricular activities as well.

          knowledge you have the better understanding you will have in any given
          problem that will come your way. It will give you self satisfaction
          and will boost your self confidence. As an individual I know it will
          help me in a lot of aspects in my life. It will give me a financial
          stability because I will be able to land a good job and a high paying
          salary. I will learn how to spend my money and will learn how to
          invest it wisely. The more education I have the more respect and
          acknowledgement I will get from people. Knowledge is really important
          that is why we need to take it seriously. It is the strong weapon you
          can have to conquer this complex world. If you have a good education
          nobody can fool you and you will not tolerate any mistreatment from
          people. It will give you a better views in life if you are well
